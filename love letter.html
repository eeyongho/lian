                    but the more I got to know you - the more I felt understood.<br>
                    You had me up at 2am, feeling hella fucking hooked. <br>
                    All my flights cancelled, all the ones six months booked.<br>
                    Let me show you that if he wanted to, he would. Let me bake, just watch me cook.<br>
                    Heart palpitations for which I mistook, got me thinking I was dying with just one look.<br><br>
                    I'm not here to impress, so relax baby - don't stress.<br>
                    Stay with me, don't leave. I want you obsessed.<br>
                    Close your eyes and trust in me, tell me what hurts. I don't want you to suppress.<br>
                    Those before may have promised you everything, I can't but I can try my best.<br><br>
                    I can't promise you the world, but I can make sure that you feel heard.<br>
                    I know you've been through a lot, I know you've been hurt.<br>
                    But please stay by my side, please stay undeterred.<br>
                    All angels like you are heaven sent, something I do not deserve.<br><br>
                    Spread your wings and let the wind lift you up, I'll be here if you fall.<br>
                    So please, lower your guard and pull down your walls.<br>
                    But baby please, don't take too long.<br><br>

                    Until fate separates us,<br>
